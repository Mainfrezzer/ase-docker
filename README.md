# SteamCMD in Docker optimized for Unraid
This Docker will download and install SteamCMD. It will also install ARK:SurvivalEvolved and run it (Normal server startup of ARK can take a long time!).

**WARNING:** You have to set the value vm.max_map_count to at least 256000 on the host as root with the command:  
`echo 265000 > /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count`  
To make that value persistent on Unraid please use a User Script that runs on startup or with the command from above or put it in your `go` file.

ATTENTION: First Startup can take very long since it downloads the gameserver files!

Update Notice: Simply restart the container if a newer version of the game is available.

You can also run multiple servers with only one SteamCMD directory!
